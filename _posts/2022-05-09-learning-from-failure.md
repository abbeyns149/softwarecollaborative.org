---

When our Intergovernmental Software Collaborative (ISC) set out to learn more about the landscape of cooperatives that share software, we came across dozens of state and local governments actively working together to buy or build software for shared needs. We also heard anecdotes about failed cooperative efforts. Knowing we can learn just as much—if not more—when efforts fail, we began documenting those lessons, too.

Read more about lessons learned from unsuccessful cooperatives in [this Beeck blog article](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/learning-from-failure-when-sharing-software-doesnt-work/), by student analyst Margaret Lin.
